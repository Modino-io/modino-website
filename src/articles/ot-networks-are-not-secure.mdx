On May 13, 2025, I had the opportunity to speak on the main stage of the **Trade Fair Studio at Warsaw Industry Automatica**. My talk focused on something we don’t talk about enough — and often far too late:  
**the real state of cybersecurity in Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments.**

My goal wasn’t to sell a solution. It was to **educate, raise awareness, and dismantle some dangerous illusions** still held by operators and decision-makers in industrial networks.

## The Illusion of Isolation
One of the most persistent myths in OT environments is the belief that these systems are protected by design — because they’re air-gapped.  
“They’re not connected to the Internet.”  
“There’s no way in from the outside.”  
“No one would want to attack us anyway.”

Let’s be clear: those days are gone.

Today’s OT systems are patched (or not) via USB drives. Vendors and integrators routinely connect via VPNs. Corporate IT and plant-floor OT now share infrastructure, identities, and in some cases, entire environments. Isolation is not a guarantee. In most cases, **it’s a dangerous assumption**.

Meanwhile, attackers have evolved — and many no longer need a direct connection to get in. Sometimes, **an unencrypted radio signal or hardcoded credential is all it takes**. And they don’t need zero-day exploits to succeed — just persistence, visibility gaps, and weak operational controls.

## Real Attacks. Real Consequences.
If you still think attacks on industrial networks are theoretical, consider what happened over the past 18 months.

### 🇬🇧 Sellafield (UK)  
In 2024, Sellafield — one of the UK’s most sensitive nuclear sites — was fined **£400,000** after it was revealed that **75% of its servers had not received security updates in over four years**.

### 🇺🇦 FrostyGoop (Ukraine)  
A malware campaign disrupted heating in over 600 buildings in Lviv. The malware — **FrostyGoop** — exploited the **unauthenticated Modbus TCP protocol**, sending false control signals to ICS devices.

### 🇺🇸 American Water (USA)  
In 2024, **American Water Works**, the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., was hit by a cyberattack that shut down billing and customer systems.

### 🇩🇪 Germany — Grid Load Exploit  
Researchers found unauthenticated radio signals were used to control grid load balancing.

### 🇳🇱 Netherlands — Traffic Light Takeover  
The KAR system could be spoofed by low-cost SDR hardware to change traffic lights in hundreds of cities.

### 🇵🇱 Poland — Infrastructure Attacks  
Polish cybercommand confirmed increased attacks on national infrastructure including energy, logistics, and public services.

> These aren’t just headlines — they’re symptoms of widespread security debt and complacency in how we maintain, monitor, and defend OT environments. And the tools required to perform these attacks? Increasingly cheap, accessible, and modular.

## The Stats Speak for Themselves
- **Average time to detect an attack in OT**: 243 days

- **80% of OT intrusions go undetected**  
  _Dragos_: [2023 OT Cybersecurity Year in Review Report](https://www.dragos.com/resources/reports/2023-ot-cybersecurity-year-in-review-report/)

- **Many OT devices operate with outdated firmware/software**, exposing them to preventable attacks.

These stats highlight a troubling gap: visibility in OT remains dangerously limited, incident response often relies on hope rather than tooling, and patching routines are either reactive or neglected entirely.

## 7 Myths That Keep OT Exposed
1. **“We’re air-gapped.”**  
   *Reality:* VPN access, remote maintenance tools, and USB updates all break the isolation assumption.

2. **“We use our own protocols.”**  
   *Reality:* “Security through obscurity” doesn’t work. Malware like Industroyer and FrostyGoop reverse-engineered proprietary protocols with ease.

3. **“Firewall is enough.”**  
   *Reality:* Firewalls don’t stop insider threats, lateral movement, or protocol-level attacks.

4. **“We can’t update — downtime is too risky.”**  
   *Reality:* Unpatched systems are far riskier. Virtual patching, rollback, and phased rollouts make updating safe.

5. **“Old systems can’t be secured.”**  
   *Reality:* You can wrap older devices in modern protections — segmentation, DPI, access control, etc.

6. **“We’re too small to be targeted.”**
   *Reality:* Responsibility lies with the operator — legally and operationally.  
   _ComputerWeekly_: [Demystifying the top five OT security myths](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366557017/Demystifying-the-top-five-OT-security-myths)
   
7. **“It’s the vendor’s responsibility.”**  
   *Reality:* Responsibility lies with the operator — legally and operationally.  
   _ComputerWeekly_: [Demystifying the top five OT security myths](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366557017/Demystifying-the-top-five-OT-security-myths)

The myths outlined above often stem from outdated assumptions — and from the belief that basic security measures are enough. In reality, today’s regulatory environment and threat landscape demand much more. What used to be considered best practices are now baseline expectations — and in many industries, legal obligations.

A mature OT security strategy must therefore include:
- Signed and auditable updates  
- Traceability and incident recovery  
- Zero-trust access and encrypted communication  
- Vendor transparency and lifecycle support

These aren’t just best practices — they’re legal obligations. And in many verticals (energy, healthcare, transport), compliance is now a prerequisite for doing business.

## So What Now? What Do We Do?
At **Modino.io**, we’ve designed a purpose-built update agent for OT and IIoT environments:

- 🔐 End-to-end encryption  
- ✅ Signed artifacts with integrity validation  
- 🔁 Rollback + full audit  
- 📡 Remote, policy-based updates  
- ⚙️ No dependency on Docker or Kubernetes  

We also support:

- 💡 Immutable system images  
- 🔄 Automatic sidecar app deployments  
- 📊 Local + remote telemetry collection  

Fully aligned with CRA, NIS2, and RED2.

## Closing Thoughts
Security in OT is no longer a technical concern — it’s a business imperative.  
It’s no longer enough to say, “That’s how we’ve always done it.”  
Resilience means change — and change starts with visibility, accountability, and continuous improvement.

If your devices:

- still run default credentials,  
- aren’t updated,  
- lack visibility and traceability…  

…then you are vulnerable.

**Let’s fix that. Let’s talk.**
