I'm Pawel Zebrowski - Business Development Manager at **Modino.io**, a cybersecurity startup enabling secure, scalable OTA updates and IoT vulnerability management. My world revolves around bridging early-stage teams with funding and partners—but startup success–investor dynamics isn't just about technology. It's about **visibility, structure, and intentional effort**. My recent journey at Carpathian Startup Fest (CSF) 2025 in Rzeszów captures how these elements come together.

## Finding the Right Events & Building Connections
At Modino, a lot of our network-building happens through **industry referrals** — a trusted colleague suggests an event, you show up. But the real game-changer? Being **introduced by someone credible**. Personal recommendations open doors; cold outreach rarely does.

My key lesson: if you’re going to invest energy, go **all‑in on being seen**. That meant applying to pitch at CSF even before knowing much about it. But a timely newsletter mention flipped the switch: this was an event to commit to.

## Applying to Carpathian Startup Fest

CSF is one of the most professional and impactful startup events in Poland. It pulls top‑tier investors, mentors, and founders. We applied to the prestigious **Puls Up competition**, and Modino rose to the **Top 10 Semifinalists** out of ~300+ submissions, thanks to our focus on **impactful pitch narrative** and real-world IoT cybersecurity needs.

## Objectives Before the Event
We entered CSF with clear goals:
- Earn a stage slot to pitch.
- Generate meetings with investors.
- Collect feedback on our value proposition.

We didn't go for vanity—just strategic visibility and connection.

## Execution at the Festival
On May 21–22, at Zen.com Expo in Jasionka near Rzeszów, CSF hosted workshops, panels, and the core pitch competitions—Puls Up, among others. The event utilized **Gridaly** for “business dating”—15‑minute meetings preluded by careful research and schedule planning.

Our approach:
- **Research** prospects using LinkedIn and CSF attendee lists.
- **Plan meetings** through Gridaly.
- **Rehearse pitch** until it is sharp and audience‑ready.

Attending with a **clear roadmap** transformed what is often chaotic into **fruitful exchange**.

## Pitch & Feedback
We pitched on the Demo Stage—3 minutes presentation, 3 minutes Q&A. Our topic: secure scaling for industrial IoT via automated OTA updates.

Although we didn't win cash prizes, we managed to reach **Top 6** and the stage presence earned **positive feedback** and **credible exposure**—landing us invitations to follow‑up meetings and a **Puls Biznesu magazine cover**. hubraum, our incubator, proudly noted:

*Big things for Modino.io! … they made it all the way to the top 6 finalists … landed on the cover of Puls Biznesu!* 

This public visibility validated both our tech and our business approach.

## Outcomes & Follow‑Ups
- **Connections**: We secured 20+ meetings with VCs, angels, industry partners.
- **Quality over quantity**: Many senior-level and strategic contacts.
- **Media validation**: Puls Biznesu coverage expanded reach.
- **Organizational feedback**: Investors flagged security as a top concern—spot-on to Modino’s mission.

Even without winning, being a **Puls Up finalist** gave us an advantage, highlighted credibility, visibility, and connection opportunities.

On building investor trust:
- Demonstrate **actual or willing-to-pay users**
- Highlight **media signals** that prove market demand

## Advice for Your First CSF
1. **Start research 4–6 weeks in advance**: compile target list, prep messaging.
2. **Apply to pitch**, even if it feels early—it’s worth the visibility boost.
3. **Book business-dating slots** through Gridaly.
4. **Prep a 3+3 pitch**—record it and rehearse feedback into it.
5. **Follow up** within 48 hours—send thank-yous, deck, next steps.

## Closing & Inspiration
My experience at CSF was transformational—not just for Modino’s pipeline, but for my work as a BizDev professional. I’ve seen firsthand how **strategy + stage = trust + traction**.

To fellow startup teams: invest in visibility. Don’t just exhibit—**pitch with purpose, meet with intent**, and **follow up relentlessly**. That’s how you turn a festival into a stepping stone.

If you're preparing for your first pitch event—CSF or any other—feel free to reach out. I’m happy to share our deck, planning tools, or even a chat. And of course, follow Modino.io for more stories on IoT cybersecurity, startup growth, and strategic networking.
