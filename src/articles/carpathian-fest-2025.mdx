I’m  Pawel Zebrowski - Business Development Manager at Modino.io, a cybersecurity startup enabling secure, scalable OTA updates and IoT vulnerability management. My world revolves around bridging early-stage teams with funding and partners—but startup success–investor dynamics isn't just about technology. It’s about visibility, structure, and intentional effort. My recent journey at Carpathian Startup Fest (CSF) 2025 in Rzeszów captures how these elements come together.

## Finding the Right Events & Building Connections
At Modino, a lot of our network-building happens through industry referrals—a trusted colleague suggests an event, you show up. But the real game-changer? Being introduced by someone credible. Personal recommendations open doors; cold outreach rarely does.

My key lesson: if you’re going to invest energy, go all‑in on being seen. That meant applying to pitch at CSF even before knowing much about it. But a timely newsletter mention flipped the switch: this was an event to commit to.
